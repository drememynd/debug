<h1>Setup Parameters</h1>

addTime - whether to use the program timing feature
The timing feature adds a timing string to the end of the backtrace string.
This allows the program to be used to do program timing to the microsecond.
DEFAULT: true

fileName - the name of the output file
If printToFile is true, this is the file name which will be used.
DEFAULT: default.txt

filePath - the directory of the output file
If printToFile is true, this is the directory the output file will be in.
DEFAULT: the top level of this program

printToFile - output to a file if true, standard output if false
DEFAULT: false

traceLevel - the number of backtrace lines to include in output
This is the global default of the program.  The single value parameter
functions also take a parameter which overrides the global default
DEFAULT: 1

useLabels - whether to use the program labeling system
If this is false, the system will not create and print labels.  Labels are
created by parsing the calling PHP files for information about the parameters
passed in.  You may want to turn this off if you have huge PHP source
code files in your project
DEFAULT: true

useWebTags - format with tags if true, do not if false
You may want to change this if, for example, you are outputting to standard
output from a PHP script that is not being used on the web, or if you are
outputting to a file, but want to view that file in a web browser.
DEFAULTS:
if printToFile = true then useWebTags = false
if printToFile = false then useWebTags = true
